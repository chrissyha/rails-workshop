Installing Ruby (2.0.0) on Rails (4.0.0) in Windows environment

1. Go to http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. Download and install 'Ruby 2.0.0-p451' if 32-bit or 'Ruby 2.0.0-p451 (x64) if 64-bit. To check if your system type is 32-bit or 64-bit, right click 'Computer' and click 'Properties.' Make sure you check 'Add Ruby executables to your PATH' in the installation instructions.

2. Open Command Prompt and type 'ruby -v' without the quotation marks. It should show you the version of Ruby you installed.

3. Type in 'gem install rails --version 4.0.0' in the command line. This should install version 4.0.0 of rails on your computer. You could alternatively execute 'gem install rails' to install the latest version of Rails instead, which is 4.1.0 as of April 8, 2014. Be patient, as Rails requires a lot of dependencies to be installed. See documentation on Rails 4.1.0 here http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/4/8/Rails-4-1/.

4. You will also need to install RubyInstaller's DevKit toolkit. This is necessary to easily build and use native C/C++ extensions for Ruby on Windows. So go back to http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ and install 'DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2-20130224-1151-sfx.exe' if 32-bit or 'DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe' if 64-bit. It is recommended to extract the files to 'C:\DevKit'.

(For more information on installing DevKit, see https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit. Or you may continue the following steps.)

5. You will need to run DevKit's installation scripts. Open Command Prompt and navigate to 'C:/DevKit' or wherever you extracted DevKit (use 'cd ..' to go up a directory, 'cd [FOLDER]' to go into a folder). Type 'ruby dk.rb init' and execute to generate the config.yml file, which will list your installed Rubies. Then execute 'ruby dk.rb install'.

NOTE: If you are using x64 version of Ruby and are getting an 'Invalid configuration' error, you may need to manually update the 'dk.rb' script in the DevKit directory. Follow the instructions at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16523607/cant-get-ruby-devkit-configuration-file-autogenerated-properly/17148987#17148987, then try running 'ruby dk.rb init' followed by 'ruby dk.rb install' again.

6. To start a new Rails web app, cd to your folder, say, 'C:\Github\rails-workshop'. Type in 'rails new rails_test'. A folder named 'rails_test' with a bunch of stuff Rails sets up for you will be created!

7. cd into your rails_test folder ('C:\Github\rails-workshop\rails_test') and type 'rails server'. Now open up your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to see a 'Welcome aboard'. You are now good to go!
